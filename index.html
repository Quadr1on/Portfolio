            <h1>ABOUT ME:</h1>
            <hr>
            <p>I am Adorn S George, I was born on 22<sup>nd</sup> Janurary, 2006 in a humble town of Taliparamba, Kerala. I lived at my grandmother's house till the age of 6 but then my parents got transfered to Nagpur, Maharashtra. At that time I was in my UKG (Upper Kindergarden). My entire childhood was spent in the state of Maharashtra till 6<sup>th</sup> Grade and agian my parents got transfered to the beautiful state of Kerala where we live in the district of Kannur. I completed my schooling in Kannur itself till the 12<sup>th</sup> grade where I secured decent marks in my boards, became my School's Co-Curricular Activites (CCA) captain, during which I hosted multiple events and managed all the non-acedeminc activites also trying to keep up my Acedemics aswell. I wrote probably the most important exam in my life the Joint Entrance Exam(JEE Mains) didn't do that well in that exam. After that wrote multiple other Entrance Exam, in some I performed well whereas in some of them performed in a mediocre manner, didn't get Comp Sci Engineering in the colleges I wanted but somehow with God's grace got in one of the top private college of India, SRM institue of technology and then I joined that college, moved to Chennai, Tamil nadu. Learned programming in the process of growing up fell in love with computers, mastered fundamentals of Python programming language, starting to find interest in the field of Web development, learned HTML, CSS, and frontend part of Javascript and some basics of React aswell, and currently trying to learn the orignal popular programming language C, Thats all about me. Thank you and peace out!</p>
